# Page-Specific Modal Control

## Modal Suppression

If you have a page where you do NOT want modals to appear, you can suppress it with the Modal Rule attribute.&#x20;

Place this on the BODY element directly.&#x20;

`wfu-modal-rule` = ( rule )

* `none` - suppresses all modals
* `default` - handles all modals as normal
