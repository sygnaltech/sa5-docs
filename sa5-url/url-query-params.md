# URL Query Params ❺

{% hint style="warning" %}
In SA5, the automatic transport of querystring params to links in the page is temporarily suppressed, while we re-evaluate the use cases and user needs here.
{% endhint %}

## Overview & Use Cases

Extract querystring parameters from your URL, and apply the contents to tagged elements on your page.

* Use querystring data in your FORM data, to collect it for submissions ( e.g. `utm_` params )
* Pass querystring data through to other links on the page, so it will get carried through
* Use querystring data in visible fields, e.g. to personalize a page from an Email newsletter link click ( “Hey Mary!” )

## Demos  <a href="#usage-notes" id="usage-notes"></a>

{% embed url="https://url-tracking.webflow.io/query" %}
Demonstration page
{% endembed %}

{% embed url="https://webflow.com/made-in-webflow/website/url-tracking" %}
Cloneable site
{% endembed %}

## Usage Notes <a href="#usage-notes" id="usage-notes"></a>

Configure everything using simple custom attributes.

This tool will carry any URL querystring params into your webpage, and apply them as follows;

* On any INPUT elements with a custom attribute of `wfu-query-param=X`, WFU will replace the `value` attribute with the value of the querystring param `X`. This works with `type=hidden` INPUT elements as well, so the data can be passed through invisibly.
* On any other elements with a custom attribute of `wfu-query-param=X`, WFU will replace the inner text of the element with the value of the querystring param `X`.

Temporarily Suppressed;&#x20;

* ~~For **all** links on your page, WFU will modify the link’s `href`, depending on what you request.~~
  * ~~`wfu-query-param=*`, or an absence of the `wfu-query-param` attribute, will merge all params from the page’s current URL into the link href.~~
  * ~~`wfu-query-param=foo,bar,bat`, will only merge the querystring params named `foo`, `bar`, and `bat` from the page’s current URL into the link href.~~
  * ~~`wfu-query-param=-` (a hypen) will suppress processing of this link, and no changes will be made.~~

## Getting Started ( NOCODE ) <a href="#getting-started-nocode" id="getting-started-nocode"></a>

### STEP 1 - Add the Library  <a href="#step-1---add-the-library" id="step-1---add-the-library"></a>

There are currently no configuration options for this feature, so we’ll use a _no-code_ integration approach.

Install JS in **HEAD**, generally site-wide.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```html
<!-- Sygnal Attributes 5 | Urls -->
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sygnaltech/webflow-util@v5.2.5/dist/nocode/webflow-url.min.js"></script>
```
{% endcode %}

### STEP 2 - Apply `wfu-query-param` to Desired Elements <a href="#step-2---apply-wfu-query-param-to-desired-elements" id="step-2---apply-wfu-query-param-to-desired-elements"></a>

_For example, use_ `wfu-query-param=X` _if you want to apply the value of param  to that element._

Applied to form INPUT elements, it will display the value in side the textbox.

To create a hidden form INPUT element, you can create it in your FORM as an HTML Embed element, containing the HTML `<input>` element code, e.g.;

```html
<input wfu-query-param="test2" type="hidden" name="test2-field">
```

Applied to any other elements, the inner text of the element will be replaced with the value of the param.

All `<a>` links on the page will automatically be affected. You do not need the custom attribute on them, unless you’re wanting to specify which params are merged in. This blanket approach exists because the primary use case we've built the tool for is referrer tracking, where clients want the UTM params passed through the site as fully as possible to a final form submit action.&#x20;

The processing of a specific link can be suppressed by applying the `wfu-query-param` custom attribute with a hyphen (`-`) as the value.

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature will be expanded on eventually with configuration options, and the ability to merge querystrings.
