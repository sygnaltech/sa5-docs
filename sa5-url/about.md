# üîç About SA5's Url Lib

Currently this lib focuses on;

* Query param passthrough for UTM params and referrer tracking links
  * Typically we're recommend using webStorage for this however GDPR and cookie rules can interfere with traditional referrer tracking mechanisms
* Simplifying link management behavior, by supporting automatic targeting of external links

## Future

We may try to fix some of the issues with Webflow localization and literal links.&#x20;

As well as to provide intelligent site-wide rel= default rules.&#x20;
