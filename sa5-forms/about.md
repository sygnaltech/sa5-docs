# üîç About SA5's Forms Lib

This this lib contains features to enhance Webflow's native forms.&#x20;

Currently there are two primary feature-sets;

* Data-binding. Initialize form fields with data, such as the current user's email address, or information from a the querystring or a cookie.&#x20;
* IP Info. Similar to data-binding, you can retrieve and store the users geoip information such as the country, city, and IP they're submitting the form from.&#x20;
* Webhook handling. Often designers want the form submission to go be sent somewhere else like a Zapier or Make interaction, or to a form handler like Basin. SA5 handles both the transmission and the response, to display the appropriate success / failure message depending on the webhook's result. &#x20;

## Future Plans

_Stay tuned._&#x20;
