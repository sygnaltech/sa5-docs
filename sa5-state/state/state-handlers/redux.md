# Redux

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, often used with React but also usable with other frameworks or vanilla JavaScript. It is based on the Flux architecture and enforces a unidirectional data flow, which makes state mutations predictable.

**How Redux Works:**

* **Single Source of Truth**: Redux uses a single store that holds the entire state of your application. This makes it easier to track changes over time and debug or inspect the application.
* **State is Read-Only**: The only way to change the state is to dispatch an action, which is a plain JavaScript object describing what happened. This ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks will ever write directly to the state.
* **Changes are Made with Pure Functions**: To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers. A reducer is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action and returns the next state.

**Services Provided by Redux:**

* **Centralized State Management**: Redux provides a central place to store and manage all application state, making it easier to keep different parts of the UI in sync.
* **DevTools**: Redux offers powerful development tools for time-travel debugging, state inspection, and hot reloading of reducers.
* **Middleware**: Redux allows the use of middleware for logging, crash reporting, asynchronous API handling, and more.
