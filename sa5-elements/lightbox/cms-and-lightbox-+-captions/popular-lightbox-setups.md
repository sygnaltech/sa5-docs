# Popular Lightbox Setups



## Featured Photos + View All Button

This UX consists of;

* A limited number of featured item thumbnails
* A button to view all images
* Clicking any of the thumbnails, or the button, invokes the lightbox which shows a much larger number of images

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (54).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The implementation for this can take many approaches.  Here we're going for a CMS-driven gallery where the entire gallery, including the featured items and captions, are sourced from a single multi-image field in the CMS.&#x20;

_Here we'll walk through the basics of the design approach, and how you can build this on your site._
