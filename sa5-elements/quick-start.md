**WEBFLOW CHANGE NOTE | 20-FEB-2025** \
Webflow has [added support for async loading](https://help.webflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/38265301927059-Understanding-per-page-JavaScript-and-asynchronously-loading-JavaScript) of Webflow.js.  This is an optional feature, however it can impact code which uses Webflow.js, such as the SA5 Elements Lib.&#x20;

The safest approach is to disable async loading, to ensure that the library is fully loaded for SA5 Element needs to connect.  However, you can try async, simply make sure to test it well.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**IMPORTANT** \
We've made some enhancements to SA5 Core in v5.5.0. \
If you are already using other SA5 Libs, please make certain to upgrade them to at least v5.5.0 as well to ensure cross-compatibility.&#x20;

Once the library is installed, use the attributes you want for the specific features you're looking for in this library. Those are documented with each feature.&#x20;

Add the custom attributes for the features you need, described in each feature separately.  &#x20;
