## Getting Started  <a href="#getting-started-nocode" id="getting-started-nocode"></a>

1. First, **add the library** as detailed in [Quick Start](../quick-start.md).
2. Apply the custom attributes to the elements you want to affect
3. Use the API & Callbacks to control the element from your custom code

See above for details.

* Setup your Webflow slider element however you like
* Setup other "control" elements that will affect it, such as buttons, etc ( optional ).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
To control the Webflow native slider, SA5 uses the slider's navigation elements such as the bottom slide page dots. It's important that they are physically part of the slider, even if you make them invisible with display: none.  Do not mark navigation elements as visibility: hidden or SA5 will be unable to interact with your slider.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### `wfu-slider` attribute <a href="#wfu-lightbox-captions-attribute" id="wfu-lightbox-captions-attribute"></a>

Add the `wfu-slider` custom attribute to the a Slider element. Give it a unique **name** to identify that element uniquely, e.g. `slider1`.&#x20;

This makes the slider element accessible in code.&#x20;
