# üîç About SA5's Kiosk Lib



Webflow websites are typically designed for use in three contexts;&#x20;

* Desktop web browsers
* Tablets
* Mobile phones

However, there are _other usage contexts_ that can be valuable as well.&#x20;

* Kiosks - where some or all of the site is available in a touchscreen environment, typically keyboardless, with a tablet-like touch UX. &#x20;
* Displays - which present content from the website, using screens, scrolling, audio, and video to both entertain the viewer and inform them about current specials, products, and services.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For _kiosks_, the _display_ context combines exceptionally well as a special, automatic mode.  When the kiosk is not in use, we can ideally switch to a display mode to engage users and inform them of new products and services, while preventing screen burn-in.&#x20;

## Use Cases

Here are some examples of Kiosk and Display mode for a Webflow site being used in real world situations. &#x20;
