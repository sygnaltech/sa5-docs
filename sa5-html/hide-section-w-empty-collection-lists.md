# Hide Section w/ Empty Collection Lists ‚ù∫

In page designs, there is often a need for an entire section to completely disappear when it has no CMS data to show.&#x20;

Consider this section;

```
DIV - News Section
  Heading - "Recent news"
  Collection List - News, filtered to past 30 days 
```

Webflow offers a "no items found" state for the collection list itself- however in this case, when there is no recent news to show, we may want the entire section to simply disappear.&#x20;

_This solution provides two simple attributes-based methods to do just that._&#x20;

## Use Cases

* News sections
* Alerts bars
* Popup special
* Finsweet filtered views &#x20;
* etc.&#x20;

## Getting Started <a href="#getting-started-nocode" id="getting-started-nocode"></a>

### STEP 1 - Add the Library <a href="#step-1---add-the-library" id="step-1---add-the-library"></a>

First, **add the library** as detailed in [Quick Start](quick-start.md).&#x20;

### STEP 2 - Add the Attributes  <a href="#step-2---apply-wfu-hide-section-or-element-you-want-to-hide" id="step-2---apply-wfu-hide-section-or-element-you-want-to-hide"></a>

Apply _either_ `wfu-hide` or `wfu-suppress` to the sections you want to hide.&#x20;

_See below for the differences, and usage details._

## Usage Notes <a href="#usage-notes" id="usage-notes"></a>

We have two slightly different solutions here, depending on your needs. &#x20;

* `wfu-hide` - Hides the section when all collection lists within it are empty&#x20;
* `wfu-suppress` - Removes the section when all collection lists within it are empty&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
In both solutions, if ALL of the collection lists within the attribute-tagged section are empty, the entire section will be hidden.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### `wfu-hide` = `empty lists`

_Hides_ the section when all collection lists within it are empty.&#x20;

Add this attribute directly to the section you want hidden. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Hide** mode is CSS-based- however it is dynamic and will work with Finsweet's CMS filter.
{% endhint %}

### `wfu-suppress` = `empty lists`

_Removes_ the section when all collection lists within it are empty. &#x20;

Add this attribute directly to the section you want suppressed.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Suppress** mode is JS-based and will work with all browsers- however it executes at page load time, and will not respond to dynamic list changes after the page has loaded.
{% endhint %}

### What's the Difference?&#x20;

Here are the differences between the two attributes.&#x20;

## Technical Notes <a href="#getting-started-nocode" id="getting-started-nocode"></a>

**Hide** mode is 100% CSS-based, and leverages the  `:has()` pseudoselector. However this CSS feature is not yet [supported](https://caniuse.com/css-has) by all browsers, most notably Firefox. If you need 100% browser coverage, you should use our **Suppress** mode until Firefox implements :has fully.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
As of Aug-2023, Firefox has about 7% desktop share, but almost 0% mobile. If your site primarily targets mobile users, Firefox's lack of support for CSS :has will not affect you.&#x20;
