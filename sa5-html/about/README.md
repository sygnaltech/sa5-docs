# üîç About SA5's HTML Lib

This this lib contains a huge range of tools that involve HTML manipulation.

Because there is such a huge range of functionality, it's better to read through the individual features you need to see their capabilities and setup options.&#x20;

## Important Notes

2024-05-18 - The Layout module has been relocated from the HTML Lib to a new Layout-specific Lib. If you need this feature, make certain to import that library.&#x20;

## Future Plans

_Stay tuned._&#x20;
