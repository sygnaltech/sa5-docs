### Markdown "elements"

You can convert a standalone HTML Embed element into a&#x20;

\[wfu-markdown]

### Embedding Tables from Google Docs

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```html
<script type="wfu-embed">
{
  "type": "gdoc",
  "version": "1",
  "src": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CFPmlJ0WmYbtQCyf8NaVCilnxfc0ah9wpm4XpE2b4zo/edit",
  "selector": "table:eq(0)",
  "theme": "default"
}
</script>
```
{% endcode %}

Store HTML directly in CMS text fields, and render them in decoded form on the page.

## Use Cases&#x20;

Good for‚Ä¶

* 3rd party embeds like SoundCloud, and YouTube
* JSON+LD embeds

## Usage Notes <a href="#usage-notes" id="usage-notes"></a>

Create an HTML Embed or plain-text element on your page, data-bound to the CMS if you like.

### `wfu-decode` attribute <a href="#wfu-decode-attribute" id="wfu-decode-attribute"></a>

Add this to the HTML Embed element you want the contents decoded for. No value needed.

Note that the CSS will hide this element initially until after it‚Äôs decoded, at which point we make it visible.

## Getting Started ( NOCODE ) <a href="#getting-started-nocode" id="getting-started-nocode"></a>

### STEP 1 - Add the Library <a href="#step-1---add-the-library" id="step-1---add-the-library"></a>

First, **add the library** as detailed in [Quick Start](quick-start.md).&#x20;

### STEP 2 - Apply the custom attributes as desired <a href="#step-2---apply-wfu-decode-to-the-html-embed-element-you-want-to-decode" id="step-2---apply-wfu-decode-to-the-html-embed-element-you-want-to-decode"></a>

See above for details.

## Technical Notes & Credits

Uses Showdown.js for the Markdown conversion

In your live site, the markdown elements are initially hidden until they are processed. Users may see an empty space briefly before the markdown conversion happens.&#x20;

For very large tables ( which this is not suited for ) that may result in a content layout shift.&#x20;
