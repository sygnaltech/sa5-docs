# ðŸš€ Quick Start | SA5 HTML

{% hint style="success" %}
All of SA5's HTML features are now consolidated into a single library, so you only need one library include.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## How to Add the Library <a href="#step-1---add-the-library" id="step-1---add-the-library"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is using SA5's new TypeScript-based library, so it is has different URLs and _code placement_ from the v4 JS-based library.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Add this script to the **site wide** custom code **before HEAD** area of your site. If you are only using it on specific pages, you can add it to **page-specific** custom code instead.
