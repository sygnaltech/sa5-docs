## Usage Notes

### I want this DIV / element to be the target container for layout operations&#x20;

`wfu-layout` = NAME

NAME can be any unique arbitrary string to identify that container. It can also be bound to a collection list slug for more dynamic, powerful layouts.

Future;&#x20;

`wfu-layout-priority` = NUMBER ( optional )

Control the sequence of layout operations.&#x20;

`wfu-layout-zone` = IDENTIFIER ( optional )&#x20;

If you have multiple such layouts, you'll be able to also identify a zone as a namespace to prevent slugs from conflicting.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**FUTURE**

In Webflow, `wfu-layout` is often easily used with CMS data-bound attributes and item slugs.  Since this could create multiple targets with the same name on a page, you can use `wfu-layout-zone` with an arbitrary identifier to isolate these areas and prevent namespace conflicts or overlaps.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### I want this element to be moved / copied into a layout container&#x20;

`wfu-layout-item-to` = CONTAINER-NAME&#x20;

Identifies an element to move into a new layout position&#x20;

`wfu-layout-item-position` =&#x20;

* `bottom` | `end` (default) - layout at the bottom of the container
* `top` | `start` - layout at the top of the container &#x20;

`wfu-layout-handler` (optional)

* (none) (default)
* tabs - must be placed on a tabs container&#x20;

`wfu-layout-init` (optional)

* (none) (default) - do nothing
