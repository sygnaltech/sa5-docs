* CMS compatible
* Can possibly optimizes portrait and landscape and square orientations

Approach;

Setup;

* Set the grid to 12 cols, all breakpoints&#x20;
* Set your row height to what you want
* Cover container class for card&#x20;
  * Image
  * Video
  * Other

Layout engine approach;

* Divide images into row groupings&#x20;
  * At mobile landscape+, 2 to 3
    * Avoiding any 1-item rows&#x20;
  * At mobile portrait, we can either shrink everything, or switch to a 1 col view&#x20;
* Responsiveness
  * Breakpoint change triggers
  * Override grid, or forc

Advanced;

* Hinting&#x20;
  * CMS can indicate if the card is portrait, square, or landscape
    * wfu-gallery-item-orientation = portrait | square | landscape
    * We use this to optimize a column config for each set&#x20;



When a client wants a distinctive layout like this, I use a collection list in a grid format, with the grid set to 12 columns.

If your layout were manual- then you could just store a field with the number of columns you want for each tile, and manually arrange them in 12-col rows, e.g. 3+9, 6+6, 4+4+4, 3+6+3â€¦ whatever.

Here it sounds like you want it to be automatic which means that you need to custom code a simple layout engine to make those determinations for you and apply those colspans to ensure 12-col rows.

I usually do 2 to 4 images per row at desktop, and 3 to 9 colspan per item, depending. Itâ€™s all about simple calcs and building an adaptable layout engine.

Portrait v. Landscape is more difficult, youâ€™re going to end up cropping things regardless. To optimize for it, I use hints, so in the CMS, Iâ€™ll indicate for each item whether its tile is portrait or landscape, and the my engine will use those hints to choose the best layout for a row.

Important- there are always sizing and cropping challenges, but there are two techniques you can use to make this work best;

* Have the layout engine first divide your image set into rows, and avoid any 1-item rows. Go for 2 to 3 items per row always, that avoids isolating a portrait image on its own 12-col row, where most of it would be cropped.
* The images you use to represent each of the tiles should ideally always have the visual interest right at the center of the photo.

Youâ€™ll definitely need a programmer to build that part, unless you can find a library that already has that encoded. Give me a shout if you need a pro to build this.
