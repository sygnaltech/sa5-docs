# Breakpoints ‚ù∫

## Overview

Webflow has 7 distinct breakpoints that act as the center of its responsive design methodology throughout the designer and in its published sites.&#x20;

Not only are all styles tied to breakpoints, but interactions can be as well.

_But what about your custom code?_&#x20;

Now, there's a way to do that too.&#x20;

## Use Cases

* Manipulate DOM or UX aspects that are beyond the capabilities of pure CSS or styles.
* A great example of this is our responsive pagination example that uses our breakpoints library with custom code to update Finsweet's CMS Load APIs.&#x20;
* Reload an IFRAME or other element that cannot adapt responsively across breakpoint changes.&#x20;

## Demonstration <a href="#getting-started-nocode" id="getting-started-nocode"></a>

On sygnal.com;

* Press F2 to access the user-specific homepage ( for logged in users only )
* CTRL+P Takes you to search results

## Usage Notes <a href="#usage-notes" id="usage-notes"></a>

When you include this library in your site or page, you can easily add a custom code callback to handle events when the breakpoints change.

Here's what that would look like;

```html
<script>
window.sa5 = window.sa5 || [];
window.sa5.push(['breakpointChanged', 
  (name, breakpoint) => {
    console.log("BREAKPOINT", name); 
  }]);
</script>
```

In this example, we register a breakpoint handler that is fired on the page's first load, and any time the breakpoint changes.

It will always contain one of the following values;

* large1920
* large1440
* large1280
* desktop
* tablet
* mobileLandscape
* mobilePortrait

Based on the value you get, you can perform whatever scripting you like.&#x20;

## Getting Started ( NOCODE ) <a href="#getting-started-nocode" id="getting-started-nocode"></a>

### STEP 1 - Add the Library <a href="#step-1---add-the-library" id="step-1---add-the-library"></a>

First, **add the library** as detailed in [Quick Start](quick-start.md).&#x20;

### STEP 2 - Implement your callback handlers <a href="#step-2---apply-wfu-sort-and-configuration-attributes-to-the-elements-you-want-to-filter" id="step-2---apply-wfu-sort-and-configuration-attributes-to-the-elements-you-want-to-filter"></a>

See above for details.

## Future

* We may add special registration methods that perform simple tasks without code, such as navigation&#x20;
