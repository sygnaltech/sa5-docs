# Defining Custom Data Sources

## Database

$db prefix indicates a data source type of Database.&#x20;

Database descriptors follow&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
**Shortcut.** `+` can be used as a shortcut in place of `$db.`, for example `+name` is equivalent to `$db.name`  &#x20;
{% endhint %}









In SA5, a custom data source is one that you set up and define the structure of. This difference distinguishes them from pre-defined data-sources like User Info which already have a pre-existing structure.

[Collection List Data Sources](collection-list-data-source/) are the primary current example.&#x20;

## Future

* Google sheet data sources
* AirTable data sources
* Google docs data sources&#x20;
* File listing services like Google Drive, Dropbox.&#x20;
