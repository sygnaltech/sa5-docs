# Data Sources ( Internal )

SA5 has a number of pre-defined data sources, like;

* Current User Info
* WebStorage
* Cookies
* Url parts ( path, hostname, etc. )
* Query string params&#x20;

It also supports custom Data Sources, such as those built from a Collection List.&#x20;

Each data source has its own unique capabilities, so each of them is described in its own own page in this section.&#x20;
