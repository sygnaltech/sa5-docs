# Conditional Visibility

Allow data-binding in a conditional visibility sense, where any element can be hidden or shown based on a truthy value.&#x20;

## Use Cases

Display a thank you section only if the querystring has the `#subscribed` hash. Optionally, auto-scroll to it.&#x20;

e.g. the SA5 newsletter sign-up

Show a section only if a referral code is detected ( webStorage, cookie, etc. )&#x20;
