# Why Gist?

GitHub Gist is a feature of GitHub that allows users to share snippets of code or other text content. It's essentially a more lightweight version of a full GitHub repository, designed for sharing smaller pieces of code, notes, or any text content. Here are some points about its popularity:

1. **Ease of Use**: One of the reasons for its popularity is its simplicity. You don't need to create a full repository to share a small piece of code. With Gist, you can quickly create a snippet and get a URL to share it.
2. **Embeddable**: Gists can be embedded in websites, blogs, and other platforms, making it a popular choice for bloggers and educators who want to include code samples in their content.
3. **Revision Tracking**: Like other GitHub repositories, Gists have revision tracking. This means you can see the history of changes, making it useful for collaborative snippets or notes.
4. **Discoverability**: Public Gists can be discovered by others, and there's a community aspect to it. Users can star, fork, and comment on Gists, similar to regular GitHub repositories.
5. **Integration with Tools**: Many tools and platforms integrate with Gist. For example, there are plugins and extensions for various text editors and IDEs that allow you to quickly create a Gist from your code.
6. **Usage Statistics**: As of my last update in September 2021, GitHub itself doesn't provide specific statistics on how many Gists are created daily or how many active Gist users there are. However, given GitHub's overall popularity and the visibility of Gists in the developer community, it's safe to say that Gists are widely used.
7. **Competition**: There are other code snippet tools and platforms available, but Gist benefits from being integrated with GitHub, one of the most popular platforms for code hosting and collaboration.
