A lot of new features have already been released and many more are in the works. With that comes a _major rewrite_ of this documentation.&#x20;

We've begun including our dev team and roadmap notes in these docs so that they are available for community comment and discussion.&#x20;

## Navigating the Docs

* Documentation is organized by library&#x20;
* At the top of most libraries, you'll two important pages-
  * üîç **About this Library**, which gives you an overview of the capabilities
  * üöÄ **Quick Start**, which gives you the _library code_ you need&#x20;
* Within each library the features are grouped separately
* A _lot of features_ have **subpages**- make sure to click the **>** to expand those sections\
  ![](.gitbook/assets/image.png)
* üß™ indicates EXPERIMENTAL items, which are **not yet available**&#x20;
* üìù indicates NOTES, which are primarily for the dev team&#x20;
* ‚ñ∂Ô∏è indicates VIDEO TUTORIALS, which we're just beginning to add

## **What‚Äôs new in v5?**

**The tech changes we've make in v5 open the doors to a lot of new capabilities.**

{% hint style="success" %}
If you are using v4, none of these changes will affect your current websites. \
Since all of our CDN URLs are version-locked, you‚Äôll continue to use the same libraries you are using now until you upgrade to the newer versions, _someday_, if you want to.
{% endhint %}

### The v5 Tech Stack

* We‚Äôre changing from a JavaScript ES6 codebase to TypeScript
* We‚Äôre changing fully from CSS to SASS.
* We‚Äôre eliminating all use of jQuery in the libraries.
* We‚Äôre separating classes through the library into discrete source files
* We‚Äôre bundling the distributed files differently for even greater efficiency
* We've integrated debugging features&#x20;

We‚Äôre excited about the tremendous capabilities the new stack gives us.

### **Switching to v5**

If you _choose to_ switch to the upgraded v5 libraries at some point, you‚Äôll see a few minor integration changes;

**Javascript** \<script> elements;

* Will be moved from the **before-/body** section to the **before-/head** section of your pages and site-wide code settings.
* The library URLs will change to point at the `/dist/` path, rather than the `/src/` path.
* You'll also notice that the `type=module` is dropped

**CSS** `<link>` elements will essentially remain unchanged, and will continue to point to `/dist/css/`

{% hint style="info" %}
All of this is covered in the docs for each feature, and we‚Äôll update the docs as each library is migrated, so that you can upgrade them if you choose to.
{% endhint %}

#### What about attribute or code changes?

When v5 is completed, you should be able to simply reference the new libraries _with no changes_ to your _custom attributes_ or existing features- and you‚Äôll still get the extended feature set and performance benefits.

If any breaking changes are introduced in v5, we'll specify the feature that is affected and what is different in its capabilities or configuration. You'll know before you upgrade that features.

#### Will I need to upgrade to v5 eventually?

**Nope!** If you‚Äôre happy with things as they are and don‚Äôt need any of the new features, you don‚Äôt need to change a thing.&#x20;

_**Even when v5 is fully released, v4 will continue to run indefinitely.**_&#x20;
