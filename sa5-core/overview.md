# SA5 Core ‚ù∫

SA5 Core is the center of the SA5 library and provides centralized functionality to the rest of our library infrastructure.&#x20;

It provides;

* Webflow design-time support
* Certain core functions
* Global variables & constants
* Central datastore&#x20;
* Event handler registration and tracking

{% hint style="info" %}
Most of these capabilities are internal-facing and are probably not useful to Webflow designers and developers. However there are a few important features here that are particularly useful to advanced designers.
