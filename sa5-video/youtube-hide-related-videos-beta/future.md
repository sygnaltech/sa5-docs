Consider a redesign that support some form of panel-based overlay&#x20;

* In-designer content support
* In-designer styling support
* CMS content-binding support&#x20;
* Allows different styling per-video&#x20;

This design would likely include a separate DIV with an named overlay tag, and the ability to-&#x20;

* Specify overlays per-video, or to use a default unnamed one&#x20;
* Specify different overlays for pause v. stop&#x20;

## Other ideas&#x20;

* Consider support for lightbox videos&#x20;
* Consider support for **Webflow's Video** element&#x20;
