# Future - Date formatting

Currently SA5 supports day.js. It offers a wide range of date formatting capabilities.

The reason this feature requires you to specify a format handler is that it's likely we'll add other handlers in the future such as Luxon, which have different formatting string capabilities.&#x20;

## Date Features

Moment offers some pretty great features that we may extend into attributes, such as;

* Relative time, e.g. time until and time since displays, e.g. "7 days until..." or "Published 23 days ago".&#x20;
* Locale support. We'll wait to see how Webflow's localization features shape up.&#x20;
* Calendar time



## Local Time

Convert site time to the user's local time
