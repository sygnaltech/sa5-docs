# üîç About SA5's Booking Lib

Just like ECommerce, many sites rely on bookings the primary means of bringing new customers in.

## General goals

* Simplify booking integrations, by using attributes
* Leverage system integration options, so that you can shorten the booking path, by pre-selecting
  * Location of the booking ( e.g. multiple clinics or salons )&#x20;
* Improve the accessibility of desktop v. mobile bookings
* Enhance booking pop-ups where it makes sense, e.g. pop-up modals and modal interactions

## Current features

* Tag any button with attributes that allow you to trigger a booking
* Pre-set that booking with any of these constraints ( zero or more );&#x20;
  * Location ( e.g. which clinic )
  * Provider ( e.g. which staff member )
  * Service Category
  * Service

## Future&#x20;

### Expand Triggers

Enter a page and trigger booking, using e.g. `#book` on the URL.

Allow for in-text link bookings, e.g. `##...` so that bookings can be triggered from within article text, blog text, or news / press releases.&#x20;
