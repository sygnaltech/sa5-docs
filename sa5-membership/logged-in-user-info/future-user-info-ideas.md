# Future User Info Ideas

## User Info as a Storage Mechanism

Why?

* Persistent User Preferences&#x20;
* Dashboard Configuration Settings&#x20;
* Works across Machines&#x20;
* User-specific for the Logged-in User&#x20;

Thoughts;&#x20;

? Sync and timing concerns&#x20;

? Flexibility

? Store JSON&#x20;

? How large can a UserInfo custom field be?&#x20;

## External Storage and Sync&#x20;

User META data&#x20;

## Single Sign On ( SSO ) Integrations&#x20;

Some form of support through webhooks and feedback loops for signing in to external systems securely, based on a Webflow Memberships sign-in.&#x20;
