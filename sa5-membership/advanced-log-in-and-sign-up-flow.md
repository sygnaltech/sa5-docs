# Advanced Log-In & Sign-Up Flow ‚ù∫

{% hint style="warning" %}
**BETA** - While Memberships is in BETA, this library will track that BETA status.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**UPDATE Jan-2023** - Webflow has enhanced the Login Redirect Fallback setting on login forms. See the [update video](advanced-log-in-and-sign-up-flow.md#important-update) below for details.
{% endhint %}

## Overview

The sign-up and log-in flow in Memberships BETA currently has a couple of limitations.&#x20;

As of Jan-2023, you can;

* Perform a [directed login](advanced-log-in-and-sign-up-flow.md#terminology), which redirects to the originally requested resource after login.
* Redirect an [undirected login](advanced-log-in-and-sign-up-flow.md#terminology) to any static page on your site, including utility pages like the **User Accounts** page.

There are a few things you _might_ want to do that you cannot do natively yet;

* Redirect an [undirected login](advanced-log-in-and-sign-up-flow.md#terminology) to a Collection Item page.&#x20;
* Redirect an [undirected login](advanced-log-in-and-sign-up-flow.md#terminology) to a page, including query string params.&#x20;
* Handle a user's [first login](advanced-log-in-and-sign-up-flow.md#terminology) after sign-up specially, by redirecting them to a New User page.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Directed login.** Occurs when a user attempts to access a gated page, and is not logged in. The login page is presented, and then after a successful login, the user is directed to the originally requested page.\
**Undirected login.** Refers to a direct login, where the user clicked the login button. After the login is completed, the user can be sent to a pre-determined page, by default the home page of the website. \
**First login.** Refers to the first successful login that a user performs after sign-up.

## Usage Notes <a href="#usage-notes" id="usage-notes"></a>

This library is not attributes based, but rather has routing configuration options in its setup.

There are currently two configuration options;

* `routeAfterLogin` - specifies an optional path to redirect users after an explicit login.
  * Recognizes a special path of `.`, which means, return to the current page.
* `routeAfterFirstLogin` - specifies an optional path for the first time a user logs in.

## Getting Started ( LOCODE ) <a href="#getting-started-locode" id="getting-started-locode"></a>

### STEP 1 - Add the Library <a href="#step-1---add-the-library" id="step-1---add-the-library"></a>

First, **add the library** as detailed in [Quick Start](quick-start.md).

### STEP 2 - Add your Configuration Callback

Add this script right after the library in your _site-wide_ **before HEAD** custom code.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```html
<!-- Sygnal Attributes 5 | Memberships | Config -->
<script>
window.sa5 = window.sa5 || [];
window.sa5.push(['getMembershipRoutingConfig', 
  (config) => {
    config.routeAfterFirstLogin = '/u/new';
    config.routeAfterLogin = '/u/home';
    return config;
  }]); 
</script>
```
{% endcode %}

Configure the routing options to paths you prefer. In the example above, we've used `/u/new` and `/u/home`. Replace these with the URLs you want. If you do not want a special first-login route, you can remove that line.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
These paths can be to secured pages (which require login), or un-secured. If they are to secured pages, make certain they are accessible to all users who login- this means auto-assigning an access group to newly registered users.  &#x20;
