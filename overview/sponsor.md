# Sponsor a Feature âœ¨

**SA5 has been under development for 6 years, and its development is largely directed by the needs of Sygnal's clients and the projects we're working on.**&#x20;

Occasionally, library users request special features or enhancements that aren't currently on our roadmap, or that we're planning, or that are under development but which we haven't needed to implement yet.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
**UNDER DEVELOPMENT** \
In these docs, feature pages marked with a green test-tube ðŸ§ª in the title are experimental and under-development.  These are likely already built in our own code bases, but not redesigned as attributes for the general public,, tested, or fully documented.&#x20;

_These are the closest features to completion._&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Now you can sponsor the development of those features, and they will be added to the library for everyone to use. &#x20;

## How much?

Cost depends on the feature, complexity, and our availability, but for many feature additions it would be quite low, in the $100 to $300 range.

You get;

* The feature you need
* The awesome feeling of supporting other Webflow devs around the world&#x20;
* Our thanks, and a credit to you listed on that feature page&#x20;

**If you're interested, drop a message in SA5's Forum ( link at top ), and we can discuss.**&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that sponsored features must make sense for the community as a whole and must be compatible with SA5's engineering roadmap.  If yours is not, it can still be developed for you privately as a site-specific feature just for your project.&#x20;

See our [Webflow development & micro-consulting](https://www.sygnal.com/webflow) options for details.&#x20;
