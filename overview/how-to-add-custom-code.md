# How to Add Custom Code

If you're unfamiliar with Webflow, it has 5 distinct areas where you can place custom code-

* The [site-wide HEAD area](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/custom-code-in-the-head-and-body-tags#head-code). Under site settings on the Custom Code tab, this section is currently called **Head Code**. &#x20;
* The [site-wide BODY area](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/custom-code-in-the-head-and-body-tags#footer-code). Under site settings on the Custom Code tab, this section is currently called **Footer Code**.&#x20;
* A [specific page's HEAD area](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/custom-code-in-the-head-and-body-tags#in-the-%3Chead%3E-tag). Under page settings towards the bottom, this section is currently called **Inside \<head> tag.**
* A [specific page's BODY area](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/custom-code-in-the-head-and-body-tags#before-the-%3C-body%3E-tag). Under page settings towards the bottom, this section is currently called **Before \</body> tag**.
* An [HTML Embed element](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/custom-code-embed?topics=elements) on your page, Anywhere on your page, added from the elements panel.&#x20;

Here's a walkthrough of how to access and use the 5 areas.&#x20;
