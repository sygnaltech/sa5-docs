# How to Add Custom Code

If you're unfamiliar with Webflow, it has 5 distinct areas where you can place custom code-

* The site-wide HEAD area. Under site settings on the Custom Code tab, this section is currently called **Head Code**. &#x20;
* The site-wide BODY area. Under site settings on the Custom Code tab, this section is currently called **Footer Code**.&#x20;
* A specific page's HEAD area. Under page settings towards the bottom, this section is currently called **Inside \<head> tag.**
* A specific page's BODY area. Under page settings towards the bottom, this section is currently called **Before \</body> tag**.
* An HTML Embed element on your page, Anywhere on your page, added from the elements panel.&#x20;

Here's a walkthrough of how to access and use the 5 areas.&#x20;
