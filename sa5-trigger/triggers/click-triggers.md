# Click Triggers

Place





## Example&#x20;

Trigger;

```
<a wfu-trigger-click="my-event">Click me</a>
```

Action;

```
<button wfu-action-click="my-event">Hidden button</button>
```

In Webflow's current Interactions ( IX2 ), the button would then be set as a click trigger to trigger the interaction.&#x20;
