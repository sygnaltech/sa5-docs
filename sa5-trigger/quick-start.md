[Add this script](../overview/how-to-add-custom-code.md) to the **page-specific** or **site wide** custom code **HEAD** area of your site or page.&#x20;

Install this code in **before HEAD**, site-wide or on the specific pages you want the script to affect.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```html
<!-- Sygnal Attributes 5 | Trigger --> 
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sygnaltech/webflow-util@5.2.25/dist/nocode/webflow-ix.js"></script> 
```
