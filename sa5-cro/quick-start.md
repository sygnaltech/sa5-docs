## How to Add the Library  <a href="#step-1---add-the-library" id="step-1---add-the-library"></a>

{% hint style="warning" %}
**IMPORTANT** \
We've made some enhancements to SA5 Core in v5.5.0. \
If you are already using other SA5 Libs, please make certain to upgrade them to at least v5.5.0 as well to ensure cross-compatibility.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

[Add this script](../overview/how-to-add-custom-code.md) to the **page-specific** or **site wide** custom code **HEAD** area of your site or page.&#x20;

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```html
<!-- Sygnal Attributes 5 | CRO --> 
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sygnaltech/webflow-util@5.6.0/dist/nocode/webflow-cro.js"></script>
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Once the library is installed, use the attributes you want for the specific features you're looking for in this library. Those are documented with each feature.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Add the custom attributes for the features you need, described in each feature separately. &#x20;

## SA5 Library Developers

For SA5 library developers, use the extended syntax to support [Sygnal DevProxy](https://engine.sygnal.com/devproxy).&#x20;
