# üîç About Hyperflow

{% hint style="info" %}
**Hyperflow** is internal Sygnal tech that we progressively develop and utilize on our client projects. It's not part of SA5's open source archive, and not designed to be self-implemented. Each client configuration is unique, and we hand build, customize and configure each client's reverse proxy specially.&#x20;

If you see features here that you need on your site, contact us.
