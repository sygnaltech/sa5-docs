# üîç About Sygnal's Hyperflow

**Hyperflow** is collection of services that Sygnal progressively develops and utilizes on our client projects.

{% hint style="info" %}
Hyperflow is _not_ part of SA5's open source archive, and _not_ designed to be self-implemented. Each client configuration is unique, and we hand build, customize and configure each client's reverse proxy specially.&#x20;

If you see features here that you need on your site, _contact us_.
