# Webflow Preview Link ‚ù∫

Enables you to dynamically construct a Webflow preview link to the current page.

## What is a Preview Link? <a href="#what-is-a-preview-link" id="what-is-a-preview-link"></a>

In Webflow, a [preview link](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/share-your-project-and-invite-collaborators) is a special link that allows someone to view a read-only version of your Webflow site in the designer.

### What would you Use this for? <a href="#what-would-you-use-this-for" id="what-would-you-use-this-for"></a>

If you develop Webflow sites, and want to make it easy for someone to click a button that switches the current page into a design mode view, this utility enables that.

* You must have created a preview link to your site, and extract the preview link Id. It looks something like this- `4d388483d99c6cc36c58ae966e92c615`.

* Does not work with Collection pages, since they require an additional collection item ID that is not emitted into the page.
