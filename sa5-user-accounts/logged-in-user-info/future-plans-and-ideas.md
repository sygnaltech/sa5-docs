# ‚è© Future Plans & Ideas

{% hint style="info" %}
Much of the current advanced work we're doing with User Accounts utilizes a new framework we're developing called Hyperflow. It runs as a reverse proxy combined with integrated client-side libraries and offers a ton of advantages in capabilities and performance that the client-side only SA5 libs cannot.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## User Info as a Storage Mechanism

Why?

* Persistent User Preferences&#x20;
* Dashboard Configuration Settings&#x20;
* Works across Machines&#x20;
* User-specific for the Logged-in User&#x20;

Thoughts;&#x20;

? Sync and timing concerns&#x20;

? Flexibility

? Store JSON&#x20;

? How large can a UserInfo custom field be?&#x20;

## External Storage and Sync&#x20;

User META data&#x20;

## Single Sign On ( SSO ) Integrations&#x20;

Some form of support through webhooks and feedback loops for signing in to external systems securely, based on a Webflow Memberships sign-in.&#x20;
