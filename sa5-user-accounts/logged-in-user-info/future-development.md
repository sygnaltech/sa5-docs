# Future Development

## User Custom Fields

Webflow Memberships allows for several custom field types as part of a User's account. These can be managed through;

* The Designer user manager
* The API
* During Sign Up, if you add those fields to the UI
* On the User Account screen, if you add those fields to the UI

CUI v3 aims to provide access to these fields both through Sygnal Attributes data-binding and directly through JavaScript. All fields will be part of the UserInfo object, as a map under the data element.

These will be named based on your defined field names, using Webflow's generated internal field names for each.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Webflow CMS and User data storage systems generate internal field names based on the generated slug, however there are situations where the slug and the internal field name will mismatch. For example, if you rename your slug field, Webflow will keep the original name as its internal field name.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
e.g. `Full Name` would be accessible in the user object as `user.data.full-name`
{% endhint %}

As of Feb-2023, these are Webflow's current field types, and our current plans;&#x20;
