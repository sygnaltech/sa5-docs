# üîç About SA5's Webflow User Accounts Lib

This library extends Webflow's Memberships feature with a few much needed features;

## Current User Info

SA5 gives you the ability to access the currently logged-in user's info from anywhere in your site. You can access user data in your custom code, or display it through our attribute-based data-binding.&#x20;

You can access _everything_...

* Name, email, and opt-in&#x20;
* Custom user data fields that you've defined
* The user's list of access groups&#x20;

## Memberships Navigation

SA5 also gives you the ability to route users specially during the Memberships process, during login and sign-up processes.

* Route a user after login
* Route a user specially after the first login

To get started, see **Quick Start**.&#x20;
