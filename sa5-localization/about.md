# üîç About SA5's Localization Lib

This feature is all about making Webflow's Localization feature more functional.

* Possible scripted locale detection and routing, plus geo-IP routing (?) Hyperflow is a smoother approach here.&#x20;
* Smart detection and state reporting
  * Current locale detection
  * Locale change detection
  * Locale list determination&#x20;
* Help users get where they're going
* Repair navigation issues, e.g. with User Accounts, Logout, the Access Denied page, etc.

### Locales Switcher

We may add these features;

* Control the appearance, change localization of the names, add flags
* Control the sort order of the switcher&#x20;
* Possibly, handle special redirect and navigation situations
