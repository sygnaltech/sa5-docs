# ðŸš€ Quick Start | SA5 Hotkeys

## How to Add the Library <a href="#step-1---add-the-library" id="step-1---add-the-library"></a>

[Add this script](../overview/how-to-add-custom-code.md) to the **page-specific** or **site wide** custom code **HEAD** area of your site or page.&#x20;

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```html
<!-- Sygnal Attributes 5 | Hotkeys -->
<script defer
src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sygnaltech/webflow-util@5.2.31/dist/nocode/webflow-hotkeys.js"
></script> 
```
{% endcode %}

Nothing is needed in the before BODY code area.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
Once the library is installed, use the attributes you want for the specific features you're looking for in this library. Those are documented with each feature.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
