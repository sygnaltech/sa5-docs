### When to Use

Google actually has some fairly strict and easy requirements if you want to use this type of markup:

* only use it for educational content that fits the criteria for a course i.e. lectures, lessons, or modules in a particular subject
* the course must have ‚Äù an explicit educational outcome of knowledge and/or skill in a particular subject and/or topic, and be led by one or more instructors with a roster of students.‚Äù
* e.g. a general event such as ‚Äúhow to make eggs‚Äù is not a course
